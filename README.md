# A Machine Learning experiment

I obtained a dataset from Kaggle which contained information about worldwide video game sales. 
I used Linear Regression to predict the sales of various video games based on the score critics gave the video game.
This project helped me better understand Machine Learning and the Linear Regression model. I also learnt how to clean up datasets 
effectively.
